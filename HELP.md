## Image Generation

### Supported Backends

| Backend | Auth | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **SD WebUI / Forge** | URL | Local Stable Diffusion server (`--api` flag required) |
| **ComfyUI** | URL | Local ComfyUI node-graph server |
| **DALL-E (OpenAI)** | API Key | Models: dall-e-3, dall-e-2 |
| **Stability AI** | API Key | Stability AI REST API |
| **Pollinations** | API Key | Pollen credits (pay-as-you-go) — models: flux, flux-realism, flux-anime, flux-3d, turbo |
| **HuggingFace** | API Key | HF Inference API — configurable model ID |

### Generating from Chat

1. **Long-press** any message → **Generate Image**.
2. Choose a mode: **Background** (landscape scene) or **Character** (portrait).
3. Your LLM automatically generates an image prompt from the message context.
4. Edit the prompt if desired, then tap **Generate**.
5. When complete: **Save to Gallery** or **Set as Chat Background**.

### Per-Character Avatar Toggle

In Character mode, a "Use avatar as reference" switch appears. When enabled, the character's avatar is used as an img2img reference for more consistent results. Disable it for characters whose avatars don't contain a face or body. This setting is saved per-character.

### Avatar Generation

When creating or editing a character, tap the avatar area → **Generate with AI**. This uses your configured image generation backend to create an avatar.

If you're using KoboldCpp on the same machine as SD WebUI, PocketTavern automatically unloads the language model from VRAM before starting image generation, then reloads it afterwards.

### Image Generation Settings

Configure under **Settings → Image Generation**:

- **Backend selector** — Switch between all six backends.
- **URL / API Key** — Shown only when the active backend requires them.
- **Sampler and Model** — Fetched dynamically from SD WebUI and ComfyUI. Tap **Fetch Options** to refresh.
- **Steps** (1–150), **CFG Scale** (1–30), **Seed** (-1 = random).
- **Resolution presets** — Portrait 512x768, Landscape 768x512, Square 512x512, HD Portrait 768x1024, HD Landscape 1024x768, HD Square 1024x1024.
- **Negative prompt** — Text describing what to avoid in generation.
- **CLIP Skip** (SD WebUI / Forge only).
- **Test Connection** — Verify the backend is reachable.

## Text-to-Speech (TTS)

### Providers

| Provider | How it works |
|----------|-------------|
| **System TTS** | Uses Android's built-in speech engine. Works offline with your device's installed voices. |
| **OpenAI-Compatible** | Sends text to any server implementing `POST /v1/audio/speech`. Works with OpenAI, Kokoro, AllTalk, XTTS, and others. |

### Configuration

Go to **Settings → Text-to-Speech**:

- **Provider** — Choose System or OpenAI-Compatible.
- **Auto-play** — Automatically speak new AI messages as they arrive.
- **Speed** — Playback rate from 0.5x to 2.0x.
- **Voice** — Select from available voices (fetched from server for OpenAI-compatible).
- **Filter mode** — Control what gets spoken:
  - *All text* — Speaks everything (markdown stripped).
  - *Quotes only* — Only reads quoted dialogue (`"like this"`).
  - *No asterisks* — Skips action text (`*like this*`).

### Per-Character Voices

Each character can have its own voice override. Set it in the character's settings under **TTS Voice**. The global default is used when no override is set.

### Manual Playback

Long-press any message in chat to access **Play TTS** and **Stop TTS** options, regardless of auto-play settings.

---

## World Info & Lorebooks

Lorebooks inject relevant lore into the AI's context automatically based on what's being discussed in chat.

### How It Works

- Each lorebook entry has **keywords**. When those keywords appear in recent messages, the entry's content is injected into the prompt.
- **Secondary keys** provide an AND-filter — both primary and secondary keywords must match.
- **Constant entries** are always active and bypass keyword matching.
- **Recursive scanning** checks activated entries for additional keyword matches.
- **Regex keys** (`/pattern/flags`) enable advanced pattern matching.

### Entry Settings

- **Insertion position** — Before Char, After Char, Top/Bottom of Author's Note, or At Depth.
- **Probability** — Activation chance (0–100%).
- **Token budget** — Stops injecting once the budget is used up.
- **Entry groups** — Organize entries into named groups.
- **Selective flag** — Enables secondary keys for finer activation control.

### Attaching Lorebooks

- **Globally** — Go to Settings → World Info / Lorebooks.
- **Per-character** — Go to Character Settings → Attached Lorebook.
- **Per-persona** — Edit a persona and attach a lorebook.
- **Embedded** — Character cards with embedded `character_book` entries are loaded automatically.
- **From CharaVault** — Browse and import community lorebooks directly from the CharaVault screen.

---

## User Personas

Personas tell the AI who it's talking to. You can create multiple personas and switch between them.

### Creating a Persona

1. Go to **Settings → Personas** and tap the **+** button.
2. Choose an avatar (pick from gallery or generate with AI).
3. Enter a display name and optional description.
4. Tap **Create**.

### Editing a Persona

Tap the Edit icon on any persona to configure:

- **Description** — Injected into the prompt so characters know who you are.
- **Position** — Where the description appears: In System Prompt, In Chat at Depth, Top/Bottom of Author's Note.
- **Role** — System, User, or Assistant.
- **Depth** — (When position is "In Chat at Depth") How many messages from the end to inject.
- **Attached lorebook** — Attach a lorebook specific to this persona.

### Switching Personas

Tap any persona in the list to make it active. The current persona is shown with a checkmark and highlighted at the top.

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need a SillyTavern server to use PocketTavern?</b></summary>

No. PocketTavern is fully standalone. It connects directly to LLM backends (KoboldCpp, Ollama, OpenAI, etc.) with no middleman. SillyTavern is not required.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What character card formats are supported?</b></summary>

PocketTavern uses PNG character cards with embedded metadata (V2 spec) — the same format SillyTavern uses. Any `.png` card exported from SillyTavern, CharaVault, Chub.ai, or similar tools will work.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use a local AI model on my phone?</b></summary>

Yes — PocketTavern now runs models on-device: pick an on-device model in the app and it downloads and runs locally, with hardware (NPU/GPU) acceleration on supported phones. You can also still connect to an LLM server on your PC (KoboldCpp, Ollama, LM Studio) over Wi-Fi, or use a cloud API.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I connect to a local backend like KoboldCpp?</b></summary>

1. Start KoboldCpp on your PC with `--host 0.0.0.0` so it listens on the network.
2. Find your PC's local IP (e.g. `192.168.1.100`).
3. In PocketTavern: Settings → API Configuration → enter `http://192.168.1.100:5001`.
4. Your phone must be on the same Wi-Fi network.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Why can't I connect to my local backend?</b></summary>

Common causes:
- The backend isn't listening on the network (use `--host 0.0.0.0` for KoboldCpp, `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` for Ollama).
- Using "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" instead of your PC's actual IP address.
- Phone and PC are on different Wi-Fi networks.
- Firewall is blocking the port.
- The URL has a trailing slash.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I use OpenAI / Claude / Groq?</b></summary>

Settings → API Configuration → select Chat Completion as the API type. Choose your provider, enter the API URL and your API key, then tap the refresh button to load models. Select a model and tap Test Connection.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What's the difference between Text Completion and Chat Completion?</b></summary>

**Text Completion** backends (KoboldCpp, llama.cpp, etc.) take a single text prompt. They need instruct templates and context templates to format the conversation correctly.

**Chat Completion** backends (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) take a list of messages with roles. They use the Chat Completion Presets and prompt order editor instead.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I get the AI to follow my instructions better?</b></summary>

- Put key instructions in the character's System Prompt (Character Settings).
- Use Author's Note (Settings → Context Settings) at a low depth for persistent steering.
- For text completion: make sure you're using the correct instruct template for your model.
- For chat completion: edit the Main Prompt in Chat Completion Presets.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use multiple AI models?</b></summary>

Yes. Use **Connection Profiles** (Settings → Connection Profiles) to save different API configurations and switch between them instantly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How does image generation work?</b></summary>

Long-press a message → Generate Image. Choose Background or Character mode. The LLM generates an image prompt from the message context, which is sent to your configured image backend. You can edit the prompt before generating. Configure your backend in Settings → Image Generation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Do I need to pay for image generation?</b></summary>

SD WebUI / Forge and ComfyUI are free but require running a local server. Pollinations, DALL-E, Stability AI, and HuggingFace require paid API keys. Pollinations uses a pay-as-you-go "Pollen credits" system — get a key at pollinations.ai.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>What are swipes?</b></summary>

Swipes are alternative AI responses. Swipe left/right on any AI message (or use the arrow buttons below it) to cycle through alternatives. The refresh button generates a new alternative. All alternatives are saved.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I import my SillyTavern data?</b></summary>

Settings → Import from SillyTavern. You can import from a running SillyTavern server (enter URL and credentials) or from a folder on your device containing SillyTavern data files.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Where are my files stored?</b></summary>

Characters, chats, lorebooks, themes, and settings are stored in PocketTavern's private app storage on your device. Chats use the SillyTavern-compatible `.jsonl` format and characters use standard PNG cards, so nothing is locked in.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I back up my data?</b></summary>

Chat files (`.jsonl`) and character cards (`.png`) are stored in the app's internal storage. You can export individual character cards. For a full backup, use Android's file manager or ADB to copy the app's data directory.
</details>

<summary><b>What are extensions?</b></summary>

Extensions add features to PocketTavern. Three are built-in (Quick Reply, Regex, Token Counter). You can also install JavaScript extensions from URLs that react to chat events, inject prompts, show custom UI, and more. Configure them in Settings → Extensions.

<summary><b>Can I use SillyTavern themes?</b></summary>

Yes. Export a theme from SillyTavern as a `.json` file, transfer it to your device, and import it via Settings → Appearance → Import Theme. PocketTavern reads the color fields and applies them. Web-specific CSS fields are ignored.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't connect to local backend

- Make sure the backend is running and listening on the network
- Use your PC's local IP address (e.g. `192.168.1.x`), not `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`
- Phone and PC must be on the same Wi-Fi network
- Check that your firewall allows the port (5001, 11434, etc.)
- For KoboldCpp: start with `--host 0.0.0.0` flag
- For Ollama: set `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` before starting
- Make sure the URL does not have a trailing slash

### Cloud API not working

- Double-check your API key is correct and has credits/quota remaining
- Make sure the API URL does not have a trailing slash
- Tap the model refresh button after entering the URL and key
- Check the Debug Log (chat menu → Debug Log) for error details

### AI gives short or empty responses

- Increase Max Tokens / Max New Tokens in generation settings
- Check that your context size isn't too small for the conversation history
- Some models need a specific instruct template — make sure you've selected the right one in Formatting

### AI ignores instructions / Author's Note

- Try putting key instructions in the character's System Prompt instead
- Reduce Author's Note depth (lower = closer to the end = more influential)
- For chat completion: edit the Main Prompt in Chat Completion Presets
- Some models (especially Claude) anchor heavily to their initial system prompt

### Characters not loading or showing errors

- Check that the PNG file is a valid character card (exported from SillyTavern or similar)
- Try re-importing the PNG file
- Check the Debug Log for parse errors
- Some very old card formats (V1) may not include all fields — try a V2 card

### Image generation fails

- Verify the backend is running and reachable (use Test Connection in Image Generation settings)
- For SD WebUI / Forge: make sure it was started with the `--api` flag
- For cloud backends: check that your API key is valid and has credits
- Check the Debug Log for detailed error messages

### TTS not working

- For System TTS: make sure your device has a TTS engine installed (most Android devices do by default)
- For OpenAI-compatible: verify the server URL and that the server is running
- Try the Test Voice button in TTS settings
- Check that TTS is enabled in Settings → Text-to-Speech

### Theme not applying correctly

- Make sure the theme file is valid JSON
- For ZIP bundles: the ZIP must contain a `theme.json` at the root level
- ZIP bundles are limited to 50 MB
- Some SillyTavern theme fields (CSS, font scale) are not applicable to Android and are ignored
